### Hello, friend 👋

💡  I am a [NCI F99 Predoctoral Fellow](https://github.com/j-berg/NCI_F99_application/blob/main/Berg-Jordan_NCI-F99_2019-application_Redacted.pdf) in the [Rutter Lab](https://rutter.biochem.utah.edu/) at the [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/).    
☁ I am interested in systems approaches to deconvoluting metabolism.    
🛠 I develop and maintain the [XPRESSyourself](https://github.com/XPRESSyourself/XPRESSpipe), [Metaboverse](https://github.com/Metaboverse/Metaboverse), and [Electrum](https://github.com/Electrum-app/Electrum) open-source bioinformatics tools.
